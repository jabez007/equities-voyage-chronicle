<p>
No activity on the CTA report, but a first sell signal on the MTP report
with a full candle below the 9SMA makes the start of a bearish case. 
From looking at the RSI and MACD divergence with the max buy signal on the longer timeframes of the MTP report,
could we be at the start of a downtrend?

Bought a PUT at open to see where that leads.
