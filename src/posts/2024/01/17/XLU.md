<p>
The CTA report suggests the longs may be reducing their positions,
and the MTP report has shown several days of sell signals.
Friday (the 12th) saw a full candle below the 9SMA,
so the max buy signals on the longer timeframes of the MTP report might be at their top?

Had bought a PUT at open yesterday (the 16th) to see where that leads.
