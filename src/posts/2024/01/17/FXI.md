The CTA report suggests the shorts may be increasing their pressure,
while the MTP report has flipped back to several days of sell signals.
So the max buy signals on the longer timeframes of the MTP report might be at their top?
Caution is warranted though, as we've seen the 9-count come on for this current downtrend.

Had bought a PUT at open on the 9th to see where that leads.
