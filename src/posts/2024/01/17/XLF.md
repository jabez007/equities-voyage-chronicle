The CTA report suggests the longs may be reducing their positions,
and at the same time the MTP report flashed its first sell signal.
Yesterday (the 16th) saw a full candle below the 9SMA,
so the max buy signals on the longer timeframes of the MTP report might be at their top?

Bought a PUT at open to see where that leads.
