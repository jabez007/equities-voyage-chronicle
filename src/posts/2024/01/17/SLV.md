<p>
Tuesday (the 16th) originally looked like we might be hitting the bottom on SLV if the CTAs had flipped to short-covering,
just needed to wait for confirmation on the chart and in the MTP report.
Turns out that was done by Wednesday (the 17th), and the sell off continued.

Bought a PUT at open to see where that leads.
