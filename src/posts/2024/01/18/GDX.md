<p>
It looks like the short positions are likely to be increasing their downward pressure according to the CTA report,
and we got our downgrade for one of the longer timeframes on the MTP report.
Will we see the longer timeframe on the CTA report back off its long position before a rebound takes us out of this current downtrend?

I still have a long PUT open.
