<p>
Tuesday (the 16th) saw the potential for longs to be backing off their positions,
and by today it looks like there could be a flip to shorts.
At the same time we have a downgrade on one of the longer timeframes of the MTP report.
There is hesitation though because Tuesday (the 16th) also saw a 9 count come on.

Expecting a bounce and then will be looking for a long PUT entry
