<p>
It looks like the sell off is continuing.
Though, the CTA report suggests the shorts may be reaching their max position.
Along side that, the MTP report increased its streak of sell signals
and downgraded one of the longer timeframes.
Likely to keep going lower in the near-term?
But, should probably keep stops tight.

I'm still holding my long PUT position.
