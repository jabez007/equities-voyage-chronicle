<p>
The sell off continues.
The CTA report suggests even the slow algorithms have likely flipped short to start this week.
Meanwhile, the MTP report extends its streak of sell signals
along with downgrading one of the longer timeframes.
Are we likely to keep going lower in the near-term?
Even so, should probably keep stops tight.

I still have a long PUT open.
