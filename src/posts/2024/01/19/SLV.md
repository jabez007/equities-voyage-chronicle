<p>
The CTA report had some mixed signals on Thursday (the 18th) between the commodity and the ETF,
but the commodity appears to have resumed and extended its short position.
The sell signals continue on the MTP report,
and one of the longer timeframes received a downgrade.
Will we see lower lows or are we starting to consolidate at a bottom?

I'm still holding my long PUT position.
