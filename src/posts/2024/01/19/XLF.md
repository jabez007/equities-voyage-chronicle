<p>
No action on the CTA report,
but continued sell signals on the MTP report.
We did see a bullish close above the 9SMA and above the 3-day high,
but we still have divergences on the MACD
and, to a lesser extent, the RSI.
Meanwhile, it looks like a TTM Squeeze is about to fire.
Are we going to see a run up past the recent high despite the divergences?

We'll see how Monday (the 22nd) opens if I'm going to close out my long PUT position.
