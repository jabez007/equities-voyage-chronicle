The CTA report showed the potential for longs to be backing off their positions starting Wednesday (the 17th),
and Thursday (the 18th) showed there could be a flip to shorts.
Now today we have a downgrade on one of the longer timeframes of the MTP report.
There is hesitation though because we are past halfway in to a 9 count.
