<p>
According to the CTA report, longs are likely to be reducing their positions.
At the same time, the MTP report shows continued sell signals with a downgrade on one of the longer timeframes.
Does that mean this downtrend likely to continue past the 50EMA, or will we see a bounce despite the signals?
